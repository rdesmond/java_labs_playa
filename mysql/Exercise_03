Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from users

    select * from cars

    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"

    select * from cars
    where make ="Toyota"

    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car

    select users.first_name  , cars.model from users
    join users_cars on users.id = users_cars.userID
    join cars on cars.id = users_cars.userID;



    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

    select users.first_name , users.last_name, cars.color from users
    join users_cars on users.id = users_cars.userID
    join cars on cars.id = users_cars.userID
    where cars.color="red";



    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table

    insert into cars
    (make, model, color, year)
    values ( 'Toyota', 'tundra', 'blueish', 2004);


    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

    UPDATE cars
    SET make = 'Nissan', color = 'purple'
    WHERE id= 4;



6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "users_cars", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
