/**
 * Write one class. This class must have two methods, a main() + a recursive method. The recursive method must take in
 * an integer as a parameter. The recursive method must then print out "Hello Recursion!" as many times as the "initial"
 * input parameter dictates. For instance if the int passed to the recursive method is 10. The recursive method must print
 * out "Hello Recursion!" 10 times.
